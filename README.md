# Netflix-Movies-TV-Shows-EDA
In this EDA project, I explored the Netflix dataset through visualizations and graphs using matplotlib and seaborn
This dataset consists of tv shows and movies available on Netflix as of 2008 to January of 2020. The dataset is collected from Flixable which is a third-party Netflix search engine.  In 2018, they released an interesting report which shows that the number of TV shows on Netflix has nearly tripled since 2010. The streaming serviceâ€™s number of movies has decreased by more than 2,000 titles since 2010, while its number of TV shows has nearly tripled. It will be interesting to explore what other insights can be obtained from the same dataset.
